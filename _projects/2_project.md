<!-- font-style: italic; -->

Vertical wall climbing robots have been a subject of scientific research for several years and could be used in a variety of applications. Robots that climb could eliminate the need for scaffolding when fulfilling jobs such as inspecting and maintaining airplanes and relieve humans of hazardous tasks such as window-washing and firefighting. An important consideration when designing these robots is its method for adhering to surfaces; consequently, researchers have identified and implemented different mechanisms for adhesion, including magnetic, pneumatic, electrostatic, and bio-inspired methods. Frequently, researchers have borrowed from the geckoâ€™s unique method for adhesion when designing wall-climbing robots. Our project objective was to measure the effectiveness of a commonly used gecko-inspired adhesive in imparting wall climbing capabilities to a locomoting robot. Originally, we had planned to test our custom manufactured adhesive on a vertical wall- however, due to a lack of access to microfabrication techniques, we were forced to narrow our testing to inclined walls, and instead chose to measure the maximum incline our robot could climb without slipping thanks to the gecko-inspired adhesive feet.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
